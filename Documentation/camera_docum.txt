In UniPy, the camera generates a small "mini-object" that tracks a designated object's movement.
Working with the camera in this engine strikes a balance between simplicity and complexity.
To assign an object for the camera to track, employ the `SetCamera` function, like this:

```python
from UniPy import SetCamera

SetCamera("player")
```

In this code, we import the function and utilize it. Remember to specify the object's name from the editor hierarchy!

Moreover, you can adjust the camera's horizontal and vertical positions. This results in the camera being centered on the object, with added margins on both sides based on the x and y values. For instance:

```python
import UniPy as up

up.SetCamera("player")
up.Camera.y = -100
```

The above code shifts the camera upwards by 100 pixels.
