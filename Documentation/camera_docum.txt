In UniPy, the camera creates a mini-object that will follow the specified object.
The camera in this engine is not yet super-complicated, but it's not terrible either.
To set the object the camera will follow, you need to use the SetCamera function, example:

```
from UniPy import SetCamera

SetCamera("player")
```

Here we import the function and call it. You have to specify its name in the editor hierarchy as the object!

You can also change the x and y sides of the camera. This means that the camera will be centered on the object, and there will be additional indentation on both sides depending on x and y. Example:

```
import UniPy as up

up.SetCamera("player")
up.Camera.y = -100
```

This code will move the camera up 100 pixels.
