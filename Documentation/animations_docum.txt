In UniPy you can animate objects, or rather change position, size, etc., without having to write a bunch of lines of code.

The Object class can animate: x, y, width, height, angle, transparent, color.
For the Text class, you can animate: x, y, angle, transparent, fontSize, color.

Animations are added through code. Example:

```
import UniPy as up

obj = up.GetObj("circle")
obj.AddAnim([5], "angle = 180", [None], , [None], True)
```

Here we get an object and call the `AddAnim` function from it, which adds the animation to the queue.

- The first argument of the function is the speed at which the animation will run. In our case, each frame the angle of the object will be incremented by 5.
- The second argument is the animations themselves. You can write several animations at once. Example:

```
obj.AddAnim([5, 10], "angle = 180; x = 200", [None, None])
```

These two animations will run simultaneously.
- The third argument is the function that will execute when the animation ends (None: none).
- The fourth argument is the functions that will be executed in each iteration of the animation.
- The fifth argument is the alignment. If your object was aligned to cx or cy, and you put True in this argument, the animation will align the object to x and y. (The default is False).

As mentioned earlier, the function adds the animation to the queue as the animations run sequentially, starting with the first and ending with the last. The object automatically starts the next animation as soon as the current one finishes.
