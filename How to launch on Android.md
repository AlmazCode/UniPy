UniPy also runs on Android devices. This requires at least some kind of Python interpreter. 
There is a program called **Pydroid 3** for this, which _provides full Python with all features_. 
**You can install it from Google Play.**


After downloading **Pydroid** and running programs made with _pygame_, you may have a keyboard appear. This can be turned off in the settings: three bars on the top left 
> `Settings > System > SDL 2: show keyboard [off]`.

Then open the file `main.py`, but IMPORTANT! Open the file from `Pydroid Explorer`, not from a third-party! Then run the program.
