UniPy also runs on Android devices. This requires at least some kind of Python interpreter. There is a program called Pydroid 3 for this, which provides full Python with all features. You can install it from Google Play.

After downloading Pydroid and running programs made with pygame, you may have a keyboard appear. This can be turned off in the settings: three bars on the top left > Settings > System > SDL 2: show keyboard [off].

Then open the file "main.py", but IMPORTANT! Open the file from Pydroid Explorer, not from a third-party! Then run the program.
