# UniPy
UniPy is a good game engine to speed up the creation of your programs on a library like pygame. UniPy is multiplatform and works on many platforms: Android, Windows, Linux, Mac. UniPy is completely Open Source, so everyone can contribute!

The engine has a very user-friendly interface that makes it easy to create programs. In addition, once you create your programs, you can export them and run them outside the engine, and that's not all!
