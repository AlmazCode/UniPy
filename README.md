# UniPy
UniPy is a good game engine to speed up the creation of your programs on a library like pygame. UniPy is multiplatform and works on many platforms: Android (best option is to use IDE: Pydroid 3), Windows, Linux, Mac. UniPy is completely Open Source, so everyone can contribute!

The engine has a very user-friendly interface that makes it easy to create programs. In addition, once you create your programs, you can export them and run them outside the engine, and that's not all!

To run the engine, use the file "main.py".
All documentation about the engine can be found in the "Documentation" folder.
Before using the engine, be sure to read the file "LICENSE.txt".
