# UniPy
UniPy is a good game engine to speed up the creation of your programs on a library like pygame. UniPy is multiplatform and works on many platforms: Android, Windows, Linux, Mac. UniPy is completely Open Source, so everyone can contribute!

The engine has a very user-friendly interface that makes it easy to create programs. In addition, once you create your programs, you can export them and run them outside the engine, and that's not all!

## How to run on desktop
Instructions for starting the project. For Windows and Linux \
[!] The following programs are required:
- Python 3.x
- Git

1. Copy repository (Require Git): \
$ git clone https://github.com/AlmazCode/UniPy.git
2. Go to the project directory: \
$ cd UniPy
3. Install the necessary Python libraries: \
On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): \
 $ apt install python3-pygame \
For all Desktops: \
 $ pip install pygame \
[i]Alternatively, install everything manually
4. Start the project: \
 $ python3 main.py 

[i] If errors occur, write to Issues

What about macOS?
None of the commiters have devices with this OS. Therefore, if possible, describe the process of launching the project on this OS

## How to run on Android
UniPy also runs on Android devices. This requires at least some kind of Python interpreter. 
There is a program called **Pydroid 3** for this, which _provides full Python with all features_. 
**You can install it from Google Play.**

After downloading **Pydroid** and running programs made with _pygame_, you may have a keyboard appear. This can be turned off in the settings: three bars on the top left 
> `Settings > System > SDL 2: show keyboard [off]`.

Then open the file `main.py`, but IMPORTANT! Open the file from `Pydroid Explorer`, not from a third-party! Then run the program.
