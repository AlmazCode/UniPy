# UniPy
UniPy is a mobile game engine written entirely in Python. In it, you can create games and applications of any level. This engine is completely open source, so everyone can contribute to this project.

How to run the engine on the phone?
You need to download the Pydroid 3 app from Google Play and then open the file main.py with the Pydroid explorer and run it.

UniPy has not been optimized for PC, so if you run the engine on your computer you might get errors.

Also read the license to use the engine before using it!
